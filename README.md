A fun Discord.js bot designed to do nothing in specific.

## Usage

  $ git clone git@github.com/uniqueusername/halobot.git
  $ cd halobot
  $ npm install
  $ node bot.js

## Configuration

Before using the bot, you may need to set some things up.

### Bot Token

To run the bot on your own server, you'll have to give it a token (you can find your token on your bot's application on the Discord Developers "My Application" page).
The bot token is located in the config.json file.

  "token": "MjUzMzQ3MDE4NDIzMDA5Mjgx.Cx_LXg.BSRa9KpSA3NOHw3NP-NnyAFLd-A"

### Triggers/Responses

Halobot can automatically respond to certain messages (triggers) with specific phrases (responses). Halobot's modular plugin system allows you to easily add custom triggers and responses.
Under the 'plugins/triggers' folder, create a JSON file with a name of your choice.

  {
    "hi": "heyo!",
    "hello": "hi!",
    "hai": "hoi",
    "hey": "aye!",
    "hi there": "ahoy there",
    "what's up": "iss all good in da hood",
    "whats up": "iss all good in da hood",
    "hoi": "hOI!!1!",
    "hoy": "ye",
    "fish": "fish is not a greeting",
    "ayy": "stfu spoopy",
    "hola": "Â¡hola, mi tesoro!"
  }

Enter any trigger/response combination you want, as long as the trigger is on the left column, and the response is on the right.

## Features

Halobot can currently:
- set custom responses to user-set triggers
- "ship" 2 characters by combining their names
